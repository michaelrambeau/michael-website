JavaScript Rising Stars is the annual round-up of the JavaScript landscape.

Since 2016, at the end of every year, I analyze data from [Best of JS](https://bestofjs.org) and I provide rankings about the growth of the open source projects tracked by Best of JS.

The goal is to provide an overview of the trends over the last 12 months, by category:

- UI frameworks
- Node.js frameworks
- React eco-system
- Tooling
- ...

Over the time, the project has gathered some traction and we have a team of contributors who made the project available in several languages:

- Japanese
- Chinese
- Spanish

In addition to raw data, we provide analysis and insights about the evolution of the JavaScript landscape.
