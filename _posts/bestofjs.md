### Concept

[Best of JS](https://bestofjs.org/) is a web application that
gathers the most significant open-source projects related to web technologies: and Node.js: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML CSS...

Projects are classified under tags to let users search and compare projects in categories such as UI frameworks, React components, Node.js frameworks...

It's a way to stay up-to-date about the latest trends as _Best of JS_ shows the trends over the last days, weeks and months. New projects are constantly added (and removed too!).

### Background: why _Best of JS_?

JavaScript and web technologies are advancing faster than ever, we are going full-speed on innovation.
Amazing open-source projects are released almost everyday, so it's hard to keep up-to-date about the trends.

- What are the most popular projects right now, over the last weeks or over the last months?
- What are the most relevant projects related to a given tag: the best Node.js framework? The best testing tools?

To answer those questions, I built [Best of JS](https://bestofjs.org/).

Every day, _Best of JS_ aggregates data from Github about more than 2000 projects related to Node.js and the web platform.
