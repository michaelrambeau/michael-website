I have been building intranet and web applications with enthusiasm and commitment since 2000.

I came to Japan in 2010, I worked for six different companies, in very different environments:

- From 2011 to 2014, I was in charge of the web site of a money transfer service: [BrastelRemit](http://brastelremit.jp/home), in a multi-cultural environment.
- From 2014 to 2016, I worked on the UI/UX of a Control Panel, at [FirstServer](https://www.firstserver.co.jp/). a web hosting company where I was the only foreigner.
- From 2016 to 2018, I worked on a web application built on top of Meteor framework (full-stack JavaScript): [Shipandco](https://www.shipandco.com/)
- In 2018, I worked for [Pactera Technology Japan](https://en.pactera.com/) doing code review and teaching good practices about modern web development with React.
- From 2019 to 2022, I worked for [Medmain](https://medmain.com/), a startup in the medicine field that uses AI to provide diagnosis, designing and developing a JavaScript full-stack application (front-end with React and TypeScript, Node.js on AWS for the API and the job processing).
- In 2022, I joined [UXPin](https://uxpin.com.com/), a design tool to create prototypes with code components. I modernized the stack, tackling a huge tech debt and providing support and mentorship for a team of developers.

I am ready to take the next step, contact me if you are in interested in my skills and in my experience.
